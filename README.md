✨ Cart Quantity – JavaScript Practice Project

A simple yet powerful beginner-friendly JavaScript mini-project where I learned how to dynamically update values, handle button events, and print outputs to the console.

This project represents my starting point in JavaScript basics, and I’m uploading every small project to build consistency and track my growth. 🚀



🌟 Demo Preview

This project allows you to:

➕ Add items to the cart

➕ Add 2 or 3 items at once

👀 View current cart quantity

🔄 Reset the cart completely

All updates print instantly in the browser console.



🧠 Concepts I Practiced

JavaScript variables (let)

Event handling using onclick

Value updates (+= 1, += 2, etc.)

Console logging

Template literals

Writing clean and readable JS inside HTML

🚀 Future Enhancements

I will be improving this project as I learn more:

Add UI-based cart count instead of console logs

Apply CSS styling for buttons

Move JavaScript to a separate .js file

Add animations for button interactions

Convert it into a small shopping cart mini-app
